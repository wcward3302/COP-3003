Move our grade code to a Class should have:
    a scalar lowest grade
    an array of all the grades (the 10 not lowest grades)
    A display all grades function which prints all of these
    Move other functions and adjust to work in class
Add a class Student which holds:
    the class variables:
        student name
        gradelevel
        major
    a constructor function which sets up the defaults as
        grade level as "sophomore" 
        major as "computer science"
    a getter and setter function for each variable:
The main program should now
    instance the Student class and assignments structure
    get the student's name and set it
    display the default gradelevel and major (from the class) and ask if this is correct
        if its not get new values for them and set it
    get all the grades as normally and calculate as normally
        only now we use the structure to see the lowest grade and check directly against that record
