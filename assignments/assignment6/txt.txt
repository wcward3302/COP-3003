Our struct for assignments just isn't enough - time to refactor it into a full Class! But that's a big job so this sprint let's 
just remove it and fix our first class, then next assignment - we'll start adding real gradebook and assignment classes!

This iteration we will add a few items to our student class and remove our assignment struct (for now).

Student changes:
    Add 3 constructors (overload)
        First should take a student name as a string only and set that based on passed (then set the defaults normally)
        Second should take student name, grade level as a string, and major and set all of these based on the passed values
        Third should take student name, grade level as an int, and major and set all of these based on the passed values
            You will have to convert the int to an appropriate grade level
    
    2 private variables and 2 private functions needs to be added:
        
        Private validate_gradelevel() function
            Returns True if gradelevel is correct, can use any of below options to check
                US: "first year", "sophomore", "junior", "senior"
                UK: "Year 10", "Year 11", "Lower 6th", "Upper 6th"
                Ensure you lower case or upper case all letters before checking
                You can use your own international or US grading levels as desired
            Returns False if no match found which should cause the default to set
        
        Private convert_gradelevel() function
            Will confirm gradelevel is appropriate (9th to 12th grade so 9-12)
                If not returns lowest option (9th grade option)
            Will use the same options as the validate_gradelevel function to pick the correct grade
                These should not have to be rewritten and should use the same (shared) data structure
                Easiest method for this involves simple arithmetic over a control flow
        
        Private variables: current_grades array (10) and lowest_grade
            The grades are theirs, the assignments just record the possible 
            Use these in main as we were using the structure (which we can now delete)
    
    Add encapsulation (access specifiers) as appropriate for all other items and remove getter and setters if needed:
        student_name should just be a public variable and directly accessible
        Others are for you to decide
    Change Main as appropriate to use our new class and still function the same (abstraction is nice)
