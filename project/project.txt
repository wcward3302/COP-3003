Project idea:

'Game launcher GUI with games' 

Goals: 
    - GUI allowing user to select games
    - either play them on that window or pop open a console/terminal
    - 4+ different games, probably as many as I have time to code, but 4 is a tentative floor. 
    - Possibly keep a file to store high scores / player info / TBD
    - Maybe ask for login credentials to allow multiple users(?)


So far:

GUI -https://www.wxwidgets.org/ 
- cross platform
- need to do more reading to tell if will work for application

user info :
- probably will store info in a json or xml file along side source code

Games: 
- TBD, still reading into different options



------- notes -------
Maybe focus on game rather than launcher, get gui going, 
get a gui going, display simple info, maybe a enter button that doesnâ€™t lead anywhere at the moment
partial front end, move to functional back end, finish front end (?)

Increments is key
develop animation cycles, finished working alpha or expo demo ready to go. 
"Splash screen"? "Maybe some moving parts"
Create a checklist, keep progress going, get a goal!
incremental is good, 
SFML?
