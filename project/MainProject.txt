Project idea:

'Game launcher GUI with games' 

Goals: 
    - GUI allowing user to select games
    - either play them on that window or pop open a console/terminal
    - 4+ different games, probably as many as I have time to code, but 4 is a tentative floor. 
    - Possibly keep a file to store high scores / player info / TBD
    - Maybe ask for login credentials to allow multiple users(?)
